# 2d_Sch_HO

I presented this programm as a final project of a Numerical Analysis course at the Universidad Nacional Mayor de San Marcos, in Peru.
This project is presented to solve the 2-dimensional Schr√∂dringer equation for a isotropic Harmonic oscilator.

It uses the shooting method, implemented to work with the 4th order Runge-Kutta method to solve the ordinary diferential equation system. Also, the bisection method is used to look for roots.
